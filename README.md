### 👨‍💻 About Me

- 🎓 I’m a B.Tech student in **Artificial Intelligence & Data Science** at K. Ramakrishnan College of Technology, Trichy.
- 💻 My passion lies at the intersection of **Cybersecurity, Ethical Hacking, and AI**. I love to break things apart to understand how to fortify them.
- 🔥 My journey into practical hacking started by installing **Kali NetHunter on a Galaxy S8**, transforming a phone into a portable pentesting lab!
- 🌱 I'm currently diving deeper into **malware analysis**, **secure software development practices**, and advanced **web exploitation** techniques.
- 🎯 I'm actively seeking an internship as a **SOC Analyst** or **Software Developer** to apply and expand my skills in a real-world environment.
